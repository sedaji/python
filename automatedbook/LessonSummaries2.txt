Learn about string manipulation. A string can be manipulated via dictating indentation, or length.
'string'.ljust(10,'.') will take a string and if it is under 10 chars in length, will fill the left end with '.'
so we can now use rjust(), ljust(), and center()

pyperclip can be downloaded via pip3 install pyperclip.

''' On Windows, you can create a batch file to run this program with the WIN-R Run window. (For more about batch files, see Appendix B.) Type the following into the file editor and save the file as pw.bat in the C:\Windows folder:

@py.exe C:\Python34\pw.py %*
@pause
With this batch file created, running the password-safe program on Windows is just a matter of pressing WIN-R and typing pw <account name>.
