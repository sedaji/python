    LESSON 6 - STRING MANIPULATION
Learn about string manipulation. A string can be manipulated via dictating indentation, or length.
'string'.ljust(10,'.') will take a string and if it is under 10 chars in length, will fill the left end with '.'
so we can now use rjust(), ljust(), and center()

pyperclip can be downloaded via pip3 install pyperclip.
this allows python compatability with clipboard. you can run scripts that will set your clipboard to anything you want.

''' On Windows, you can create a batch file to run this program with the WIN-R Run window. (For more about batch files, see Appendix B.) Type the following into the file editor and save the file as pw.bat in the C:\Windows folder:

@py.exe C:\Python34\pw.py %*
@pause
With this batch file created, running the password-safe program on Windows is just a matter of pressing WIN-R and typing pw <account name>.

    CHAPTER 7 - REGULAR EXPRESSIONS
    
To search regular expressions is sort of a multi step process. Get it set up via import re
then you can call var = re.compile(r'\d\d or whatever pattern') and this creates a Regex object.
then we do var.search('String') where String contains our pattern somewhere in it. 
Finally we can do print(var.group()). This handy pattern searching can help one find phone numbers, emails, get creative!
